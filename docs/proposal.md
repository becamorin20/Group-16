## SUMMARY  
#### this is where the proposal will go...mention the main idea behind your project. At least have a sentence that clearly explaind the input/put semantics of your project What information will it take as input? What will it produce? 
#### In this project, we will train our agent (in the video game Minecraft) to learn how to survive as long as possible in it's world. We plan on implementing reinforcement learning so that it is able to meet its goal. The main objectives to complete the latter would be for the agent to be able to find and collect all the essential materials needed to survive such as food (and learn how to kill for meat) and tools (to be able to protect itself). Concurently, it should be able to learn how to navigate in the terrain it is in, such as how to climb mountains/hills, how to swim, and how to go around/ get over obtacles (eg trees). At the same time as it is learning the latter, it will have to learn how to defend itself from zombie attacks (and possibly animal attacks if it is killing). Once it is has leared how to do this will ease it's next priority will be to create a world for itself (such as building for shelter). 
#### We will create the reinforcement learning tasks as a Mark Decision Process. The agent will take in it's interactions with the environment through observations and actions and depending on the outcomes it will have a reward system. With each action the agent does the state will change based on the reward system (if the interaction was positive or negative) thus changing the way it will interact/act the next time.





## AI/ML ALGORITHMS 
#### What AI and ML algorithm(s) you anticipate to use?
#### e.g. 'we plan on using dynamic programming', 'reinforcement learning with neural function approximation'
#### 'deep learning for images' 

## EVALUATION PLAN 
#### How will you evaluate the success of your project. 
#### what is the metrics, what are the baselines,, how much you expect your approach to imporive the metric by,
#### What data wil you evaluate etc.
